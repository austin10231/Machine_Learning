# Machine Learning – Supervised Learning Practice

This repository contains my personal practice projects related to **supervised machine learning**.

All datasets used in this repository are sourced from **Kaggle**, and the projects are organized by task type:

- **Regression**
- **Classification**

Each project follows a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow, including:
- Data loading and exploration (EDA)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training
- Cross-validation
- Model evaluation
- Basic visualizations (e.g., predictions, residuals, feature analysis)

The purpose of this repository is to systematically practice and strengthen my understanding of supervised learning concepts and practical machine learning pipelines.

This is a learning-focused repository, emphasizing clarity, correctness, and reproducibility rather than competition scores.
